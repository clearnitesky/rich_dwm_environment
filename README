Updates to this file are added to the top.
New users should read through each version from the bottom to understand
functionality and changes I've made since writing about this build on my
website.

Version 0.21:

I didn't include these below:

Toggle main window		- Mod+Shift+Enter
Toggle window float 		- Mod+Shift+Space
Increase size of main window 	- Mod+ l
Decrease size of main window 	- Mod+ h
Close window			- Mod+ q
Close window (to be removed) 	- Mod+Shift+ c

Quit dwm			- Mod+ q

There are now two config.h files. One called config.dark.h and the other
config.light.h. Before compiling you will need to choose whether you'd like to use
the light or dark look. They work nicely with Breeze and Breeze dark themes.
Rename or copy the file of choice to config.h before compile.

I just added the hide-vacant-tags patch to the list. I've also adjusted the colours
a little and added JoyPixels to the *fonts in config.h
JoyPixels is now a dependency so make sure you install it.

Version 0.2:

Began version numbering, which is really quite arbitrary, but at least allows others
to see how my thoughts are changing.

The fullscreen button is a toggle. In switching to it from monocle it feels useless
as I could just switch the bar off instead. Still, my desired solution is to stop
using monocle rather than to stop using fullscreen so I am changing the default gaps
to 0. This means that if only one program is open then it is effectively full-desktop.
You can then use Mod+x or Mod+y to adjust gaps when you open muliple tiled windows if
desired. Otherwise we just use the tiled mode to cover 2 of the needed layouts and
keep the fullscreen as a toggle for use when watching videos or like a distraction-
free mode as such.

Monocle mode is disabled in config.h it can be reinstated easily, but note that it
does not currently have a unique short-cut. You can go to monocle mode, if you really
have to, by toggling fullscreen and then turning the bar back on (Mod+B).

Fullscreen mode (toggle) now has the shortcut Mod+Plus

Version 0.1:

Patches installed:
1 fullgaps
	- need to use version 6.2, not latest
2 fullscreen
	- manually add one line to dwm.c
  	- also add line to config.h
3 fakefullscreen - this is cool for watching tutorials or whatever whilst multitasking
  	-- at this point you also need extra things in the config file again --
4 swallow - a handy way of managing redundant terminal windows

may add the noborders patch at some point if I decide to use brighter border colour.
noborders, fakefullscreen patches interfere with each other a bit when using the
fullscreen patch!

removed barpadding patch - it is quite visually appealing
but ultimately better to look at than to use.

Design considerations:

Had to remove 'iscol' lines from drw.c file to allow unicode icons on panel.
I've also done the same with my build of dmenu.

Four needed layouts - tile, float, full desktop (monacle), full screen.
		    - Monacle would be redundant without gaps patch,
		      which has lead me to removing the ability to adjust
		      gap-size from the key bindings in order to enforce a
		      behaviour of using both layouts for their intended uses.

There is no minimise function for windows in dwm so I have Tag 9 as the ðŸ—‘ icon
and put things there when I'm not using them.

You might think there is no "window list" or a way to see what programs are
running but really you can just Mod+0 to display all tags at once - this is
like reveal or whatever its called on a Mac. Also you can just look at the
tags and see if there are windows open.

Colours:
This is something I change fairly frequently but something I like to do is have
the border colour of the active window the same as the sel-colour on the bar/panel.
This has the nice effect of making the border "join" to the bar and tag when in
monacle mode.

Fonts: I like the Lato and Inconsolata fonts for desktop and st terminal.
Currently the latest version of Inconsolata does not work so you need to install
version 0.2 and blacklist from upgrades. You also need JoyPixels installed for
the emojis and libXft-bgra.

Re-assess keyboard short-cuts:
Starting programs and window controls should be assigned to different Mod keys.

dmenu 	- Mod+Space
	- a standard shortcut to for program launcher, similar to both Win and MacOS
st	- Mod+Enter

Desktop layouts:
Tile		- Mod+Minus
Float		- Mod+Shift+Minus
Monacle		- Mod+Plus
Fullscreen	- Mod+Shift+Plus (this is a toggle)

increase gaps	- Mod+ x
decrease gaps	- Mod+ z

For launching programs:
Lower case letters for everyday things like browser or file manager
Upper case letters for config stuff like wifi or volume control
