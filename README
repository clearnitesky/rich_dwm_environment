Patches installed:
1 fullgaps 
	- need to use version 6.2, not latest
2 fullscreen 
	- manually add one line to dwm.c
  	- also add line to config.h
3 fakefullscreen - this is cool for watching tutorials or whatever whilst multitasking
  	-- at this point you also need extra things in the config file again --
4 swallow - a handy way of managing redundant terminal windows

may add the noborders patch at some point if I decide to use brighter border colour.
noborders, fakefullscreen patches interfere with each other a bit when using the 
fullscreen patch!

removed barpadding patch - it is quite visually appealing
but ultimately better to look at than to use.

Design considerations:

Had to remove 'iscol' lines from drw.c file to allow unicode icons on panel.
I've also done the same with my build of dmenu.

Four needed layouts - tile, float, full desktop (monacle), full screen.
		    - Monacle would be redundant without gaps patch,
		      which has lead me to removing the ability to adjust
		      gap-size from the key bindings in order to enforce a
		      behaviour of using both layouts for their intended uses.

There is no minimise function for windows in dwm so I have Tag 9 as the ðŸ—‘ icon
and put things there when I'm not using them.

You might think there is no "window list" or a way to see what programs are 
running but really you can just Mod+0 to display all tags at once - this is 
like reveal or whatever its called on a Mac. Also you can just look at the 
tags and see if there are windows open.

Colours:
This is something I change fairly frequently but something I like to do is have
the border colour of the active window the same as the sel-colour on the bar/panel.
This has the nice effect of making the border "join" to the bar and tag when in 
monacle mode.

Re-assess keyboard short-cuts:
Starting programs and window controls should be assigned to different Mod keys.

dmenu 	- Mod+Space
	- a standard shortcut to for program launcher, similar to both Win and MacOS
st	- Mod+Enter

Desktop layouts:
Tile		- Mod+Minus
Float		- Mod+Shift+Minus
Monacle		- Mod+Plus
Fullscreen	- Mod+Shift+Plus

increase gaps	- Mod+x
decrease gaps	- Mod+z

For launching programs:
Lower case letters for everyday things like browser or file manager
Upper case letters for config stuff like wifi or volume control
